<h2> Personal information</h2>
<p>My name is Minzin Thein, well I guess my name is “Min Zin”, because that’s what my birth certificate says but we can all agree that just looks weird so I go by “Minzin”. I’m born in Australia, specifically Sydney and I moved to Melbourne in 2008. My ethnicity is half Pakistani and half Burmese. I can fluently speak Urdu but there is no hope when I try to speak Burmese. I’m born on the 31’st of December (new years eve) and I share the birthday with my mother which is quite fascinating. 
My interests consists of gaming, skating, cars and just socialising with my  friends. I take my interests pretty seriously, mostly gaming and skating. I am an ex-professional fortnite player with over $2000 in earnings and I’m currently playing Valorant semi-professionally. I’m a very quick learner and usually pick things up very quickly if I enjoy it and I’m VERY competitive. I don’t like losing.  
I’m a first year university student, studying IT at RMIT.  And to sum it  all up, if you ever ask “how is it going” I’ll reply with “it’s just going, not in any particular direction, it’s just going”. Now the interpretation of that statement is all up to you. </p>


<h2> My interest in IT</h2>

<p>My interest in IT originates from me being interaction with a computer as long as I can remember. The interest grew more and more as I grew up as I learnt more about them and I progressively improved in using them. After spending most my life behind a screen (gaming) I decided that maybe I can capitlise off of me being behind a screen all the time; that is when my aspiration of studying IT came. 
As an individual I’m creative, or not creative per se, more ambitious. I want to be able to create something in the future that allows me to make money without me doing anything.  I want to create something that is revolutionary, and as technology is modernising, studying IT is the best way to make my aspirations into a reality. 
I chose to come to RMIT because it was the most convenient campus and obviously the best for studying IT as it has IT in  its name, travelling to the city is very convenient. Furthermore, at  RMIT I endevour to learn how to code, more specifically HTML, C++, Python and other coding softwares. I would like to utilise these coding softwares and create something revolutionary.

<h2> Ideal job - Cyber Security Analyst </h2> <img src="Kumbaya.jpg" alt="CSA">
<p> A cybersecurity analyst monitors current trends in cyber-crime and needs to adapt and stay a step ahead of cyber-criminals. The job offered at TQ solutions appeals in the sense that they combine “innovation, creativity and technology” all in which align with what I want to do; use creativity to innovate on a product/service. 
The skills, experience and qualifications for this position includes having significant experience in a security incident analysis and response, more specifically in a security operations environment.  I will also need to be able to used analytic tools to determine threat patterns.  Additionally, I am required to have excellent technical knowledge of mainstream operating systems.  A skill that is a necessity is having “excellent” writing and verbal communication skills. Overall the qualifications I will need to become a Cyber Security Analyst includes of IT certificates, and possible degrees of computer science and IT.
The skills I currently have now consist of excellent verbal and written communication, working efficiently  in a socially prompt environment, and adapting to work under pressure. Currently I have no qualifications in the IT field and the only certificate I hold is the completion of VCE certificate (finishing year 12). I have minor experience with Python, and have a decent amount of experience in access and excel.

<h2> Personal Profile </h2>
<p> These results from the three tests portray what my personality  is like. It highlights my strength and weaknesses depending on the scenario.  Firstly, the Myers-Briggs test shows that I’m assertive and an outgoing individual and that I’m also intuitive. The education planner quiz dictates that I’m a tactile learner; meaning  I learn by touching and doing. I’m more a hands on learner and I learn more efficiently through physical touch. Finally in the big five personality test I got the highest score on “intellect/imagination” and “Extroversion”, and also highlights my other personality traits like agreeableness, emotional stability and conscientiousness. 

These results will positively influence my behaviour in a collaborative environment as my personality portrays that I’m extroverted so communicating with people isn’t a difficulty for me and I enjoy interacting and socializing with people. I’m also a “tactile” learner, so hands on activities within the group will also be performed efficiently as it is my strength. Furthermore, the big five personality also indicates that I’m mostly outgoing as I scored 96% in the extroversion section, my intellect and imagination is also at 88% meaning that I can contribute valuable ideas which will ultimately impact the group positively. 

When forming a team I should aim to find people with similar personality traits as me as getting along would be easier and working efficiently will also be easy for us as we share the same qualities. Having team members who are also socially interactive will increase the groups productivity. When forming the group I should also look for tactile learners; who find it easy and more efficient to learn through physical activity. Overall, when forming a group, looking for people with the same/similar qualities as yourself will ultimately be beneficial for yourself, and for the groups productivity.

<h2> My project </h2> 

<h3> Overview </h3>
<p/3> My project will be aimed at all car enthusiasts and/or for anyone who are getting into cars.  Basically it will be an application which tracks your geographical location as you are in a car.  The main focus of this application is to find other  car enthusiasts in your geographical location who want to street race in that specific area. If other people using the app have enabled their location, a CGI map will show where each other are so they can have their thrill and race their cars. However, the app can also be used to find other car enthusiasts  who want to meet and potentially act like a social gathering for car enthusiasts ( car meet) <p/3>

<h3> Motivation </h3>
<p> My motivation comes from my own love and passion for cars. I have been around people and upon observation I have realized that most car enthusiasts want to race other car enthusiasts but can’t come into contact with them as they’re driving, or they just want to compliment each others cars! Using this application, now car enthusiasts are able to meet each other and street race, or just interact with one another and make friends. Personally I love  meeting new people and interacting with people, so what’s a better way to do it then talking to them after a friendly street race!</p>

<h3> Description </h3>
<p> My project idea is mostly aimed at car enthusiasts who are looking for a thrill. Through highlighting my target audience, I will be creating a phone application which allows car enthusiasts to track other car enthusiasts who want to have a social gathering or mainly race their cars using a geographical tracker. The app will consist of a very interactive user interface where they can choose what car they have, the model of their car, and what features/modifications they have on their car.  The app will also have a drop down list of car parts, cars and their models for users to select from. Moreover, the app will consist of  a tracker, tracking the users geographical location. The user can choose to turn location on or not. Upon the user allowing location, the app will show  a CGI map of their car and other  users in the near by area who want to race or just have a social gathering. The CGI map will cover up to  5km in distance and will also be user friendly as the user will be able to interact with the map, such as, moving around to explore the area(s), clicking on peoples car to see their specifications. When idle and browsing through the application, the  user will be given options of whether they want to improve in speed, looks, interior etc. The app will give them recommendations and also directions to the nearest car part store like super  cheat auto etc. This app will also be beneficial to people who are interested in cars and want to learn more as there will be a FAQ section, where people can ask about cars and the general public, more specifically the people who are car enthusiasts are given the opportunity to answer these questions. Moreover, there will be an in-app leaderboard consisting of people who have won the most races sparking competitive interest and a goal to work towards. And of course to secure safety measures the apps CGI map will highlight areas that are safe to race in and will also alert the user of traffic levels through the use of colour coding. Green highlighting traffic is close to non existent, yellow highlighting that traffic is moderate, and red highlighting that there is heavy traffic.  Furthermore, the apps built in CGI map can also  be used as a navigation system. Users can input their destination and their location and the app  will navigate.  Ultimately, the app’s purpose is to find other people who want to race or just interact with you about cars and through the apps live CGI map, users can do this efficiently. The interactive hub is also a significant feature of the app which allows users to interact with the UI freely and efficiently. Users will be able to  browse cars, and check out other peoples cars whilst also being able to upgrade their own cars by the options the app will provide. Also the implementation of a </p>

<h3> Tools/technologies </h3>
<p> Tools and technology I will need to  make this application will be an MIT app inventor as it is used to create applications.  Specifically to make an app displaying geolocation I will need to use google maps SDK or I can use Apple MapKit. To develop the CGI map I will need a computer and functioning software such as , blender, adobe aftereffects and other softwares that are eligible to make the map. For hardware I would need multiple phones preferably of different brands so I can test the usability of the application on every device. Additional hardware I will need will also be a GPS receiver, these are the most appropriate tools and technology needed to make this application. </p>

<h3> Skills required </h3>
<p> The skills required to create this app for car enthusiasts, will be knowledge of using blender, being able to create a user interface for phone and multiple  phone platforms such as iphone and Samsung. Another set of skills required for me to create this application is to be mobile application programming. I will also be required to know  how to code to implement some of the ideas I have in place. </p>

<h3> Outcome </h3>
<p> The final product of the application will be very beneficial to car enthusiasts as they can interact freely with other car enthusiasts in the area and finally race. By having a fully functioning app, car enthusiasts now can interact with the CGI map and add their cars into the user interface. Ultimately the application will provide an opportunity for everyone who loves cars, to learn a bit more, meet new people and most importantly race! I strongly believe that the success of this application will be revolutionary within the car enthusiast community. <p>
